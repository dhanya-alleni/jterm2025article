  title: "Squid-inspired jet devices deliver drugs without a need for needles"
  description: Microjet delivery systems that are inspired by cephalopodsâ€™ propulsion methods enable the needle-free administration of large biomolecules through the lining of the gastrointestinal tract. These devices not only achieve drug-absorption rates comparable to or exceeding those of conventional injections, but could also transform the management of chronic diseases and treatment experience.
