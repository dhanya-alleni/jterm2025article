title: "Squid-inspired jet devices deliver drugs without a need for needles"
abstract: |
  Needle-based injections, the traditional method for delivering large biological molecules such as insulin, pose challenges including infection risks, disposal issues, and patient discomfort. Inspired by the jet propulsion mechanisms of cephalopods like squid and cuttlefish, researchers developed microjet delivery systems for needle-free administration of drugs into the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. These devices employ high-pressure liquid jets to deliver macromolecules such as insulin and GLP-1 analogues, achieving bioavailability levels comparable to or exceeding conventional injections. Preclinical trials in pigs and dogs demonstrated bioavailability rates of up to 90%. This breakthrough technology has the potential to transform drug delivery by improving patient adherence, enabling home-based treatments, and reducing the reliance on needle-based systems. Future work will focus on human trials, optimizing jet parameters, and exploring biodegradable materials to enhance environmental sustainability.

## Introduction
 For decades, needle-based injections have been the primary method for delivering large biological molecules such as insulin and vaccines. However, this approach presents several challenges, including infection risks, disposal issues, and patient discomfort, leading to poor adherence to treatment regimens. To address these challenges, researchers developed ingestible microjet devices inspired by the propulsion mechanisms of squids and cuttlefish. These devices aim to deliver drugs directly into the gastrointestinal (GI) tract without the need for needles.


## Methods
 The microjet delivery systems were designed to replicate the jet propulsion mechanisms of cephalopods, such as squid and cuttlefish, by using high-pressure liquid jets to deliver drugs directly into gastrointestinal tissues. Two types of jets were created: axial jets for larger, globular organs like the stomach and colon, and radial jets for smaller, tubular organs like the small intestine and oesophagus. The devices were incorporated into ingestible capsules that could be either tethered to an endoscope or untethered for autonomous delivery. These devices were tested in preclinical trials with pigs and dogs to assess their ability to deliver macromolecules such as insulin, GLP-1 analogues, and small interfering RNA (siRNA). The microjet devices were inserted into the pigs’ small intestines and dogs’ stomachs, and drug delivery was tested at varying jet pressures, with a pressure of 9.4 bar used in pigs and 24.5 bar in dogs. Bioavailability was measured, and the results showed a bioavailability of 69% for insulin delivered to pigs’ small intestines and 90% for insulin delivered to dogs’ stomachs, comparable to or exceeding bioavailability levels achieved by traditional needle injections. Control groups were used to compare the results, with pigs receiving subcutaneous injections as a benchmark and others receiving injections into the lumen of the small intestine. The study also assessed the efficiency and controllability of the devices in drug delivery, with a focus on regulating the jet pressure and direction to effectively target specific gastrointestinal areas. Safety assessments were conducted by monitoring potential adverse effects on the gastrointestinal tissues of the animals, ensuring that the devices did not cause irritation or damage. Future research will refine the device design, optimize delivery parameters, and explore the use of biodegradable materials to improve sustainability.
## Results
 In preclinical trials with large mammals (dogs and pigs), the microjet devices successfully delivered macromolecules such as insulin, GLP-1 analogues, and small interfering RNA (siRNA). The bioavailability of drugs delivered through these systems reached up to 90%, which is comparable to or exceeds the bioavailability achieved with conventional needle-based injections. For example, insulin delivered to the small intestine in pigs demonstrated a bioavailability of 69% at 9.4 bar pressure, while in dogs, insulin delivered to the stomach achieved a bioavailability of 90% at 24.5 bar pressure. These results demonstrate the efficacy and potential of the system in terms of drug absorption and the controllability of the delivery process, providing a promising alternative to traditional injection-based systems.
## Discussion
 The development of these microjet devices offers a significant breakthrough in non-invasive drug delivery technologies. The ability to deliver drugs without needles could revolutionize the treatment of chronic diseases, particularly for conditions requiring frequent injections. The successful trials in large animals support the feasibility of this technology, and the potential for broader accessibility, particularly in home-based treatments, is vast. Furthermore, the microjet systems demonstrated high bioavailability rates, which could make them suitable for a wide range of macromolecule therapies currently dependent on intravenous or subcutaneous delivery methods. However, there are still several hurdles to overcome. The current study is based on preclinical animal models, and further research is required to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these devices in humans. Additionally, the technology's applicability may vary depending on the specific properties of the drugs being delivered, as well as the targeted tissue types. Future research will focus on refining the delivery parameters, exploring the use of biodegradable materials to enhance sustainability, and scaling the devices for human use. Additionally, efforts will be directed at optimizing the devices for broader drug applications, ensuring that the technology is adaptable to a wide variety of therapeutic needs.
## Conclusion
 The squid-inspired microjet delivery systems represent a promising and innovative approach to drug delivery. By bypassing the need for needles, these devices could greatly improve patient compliance, expand access to macromolecule therapies, and offer the convenience of home-based treatments. With further refinement and human trials, this technology could transform the landscape of drug delivery, making chronic disease management more accessible, effective, and patient-friendly.

@mucosal-barrier shows a depot forming in jejunal intestinal tissue, as captured by high-speed imaging. Exemplary histological images of resulting dye distribution in jejunal and stomach tissue samples are shown in @mucosal-barrier ‘Luminal’ shots represent injections in which only superficial penetration was observed, ‘submucosal’ shots are those in which the fluid was present in the submucosal layer and ‘intraperitoneal’ shots are those in which the fluid penetrated all layers of the tissue. In the submucosal shots, dye was observed to be present primarily in the submucosal tissue for all tissue types. In the intraperitoneal shots, dye is distributed throughout the submucosa, muscularis and serosa (dye that went through the entire thickness of the tissue is not shown).

Inspired by the jet-propulsion mechanisms of cephalopods4 such as squid and cuttlefish (such as Sepia officinalis), we developed a family of microjet delivery systems. These innovative devices deliver drugs directly into gastrointestinal tissues using high-pressure liquid jets, mimicking how cephalopods expel water and ink (@demo-a). Our designs used two jetting approaches: axial jets for delivery into larger, globular organs (such as the stomach and colon) and radial jets for smaller, tubular organs (including the small intestine and oesophagus). These systems were integrated into ingestible devices that were either tethered (on an endoscope) or untethered (autonomous), enabling versatile methods of drug administration.
